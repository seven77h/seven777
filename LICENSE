Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
   distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
    i) changes to the Program, and
   ii) additions to the Program;

   where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
   distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'
   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not
   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of
   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own
   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is
     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other
     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute
     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
     before distributing the Program.
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
     license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
its own license agreement, provided that:

  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
  b) its license agreement:
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
         consequential damages, such as lost profits;
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
     within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at
its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the
risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

This European Union Public Licence (the “EUPL”) applies to the
Work or Software (as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this
Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is
prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright

immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1

or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.

exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make
effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights
to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of
the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.


3. Communication of the Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Work either
in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as
Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of
the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor
distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached
to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely
accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or
communicate the Work.


4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits
from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners
in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of
other applicable limitations thereto.


5. Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

Attribution right:
the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and
all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The
Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with
every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee
must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the
Work has been modified and the date of modification.

Copyleft clause:
If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the Original Works
or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or
Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later
version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only
under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot
offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative
Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.

Compatibility clause:
If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or copies
thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work  licensed under a
Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under
the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,
“Compatible Licence” refers to the licences listed in the appendix
attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the
Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the
obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

Provision of Source Code:
When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee
will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a
repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long
as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.

Legal Protection:
This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the copyright notice.


6. Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work
granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and
that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that
he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under
the terms of this Licence.


7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
“bugs” inherent to this type of software development.

For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an “as is”
basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.


8. Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to
natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or
indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence
or of the use of the Work, including without limitation,
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised
of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under
statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.


9. Additional agreements

While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose
to conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in
accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against
such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional
liability.


10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on
an icon “I agree” placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of
this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance
with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear
and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and
all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and
all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You
by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work,
the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or
Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.


11. Information to the public

In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of
electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download
the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for
example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information
requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the
way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the
Licensee.


12. Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons
remain in full compliance with the Licence.


13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary
to make it valid and enforceable.

The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new
versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without
reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence.
New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.

All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,
have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version
of their choice.


14. Jurisdiction

between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee,
will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the
European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing
the European Community.

Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission,
and resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or
conducts its primary business.


15. Applicable Law

This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where
the Licensor resides or has his registered office.

This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:

- a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any
Licensee;
- the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or
registered office inside a European Union country.
